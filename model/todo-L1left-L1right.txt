L1left.yaml and 
L1right.yaml do both not exist yet (state 20. Nov. 2024) 
These files are needed to get the TactileContactState arrows point correctly according to taxel center and normal.
They should be generated from a python script in Blender once layout L1 is available there.

Currently L1 is displayed as an L2 without pi. Therefore we re-use the pos/normal of L2 via symlink (2025-03-25)
